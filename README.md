📚 Exciting News for Book Lovers! 📚

As a passionate bibliophile, I found the need for a clean, comprehensive book dataset. Many existing datasets lacked key information or were unclean, making it hard to gauge a book's popularity. So, I took matters into my own hands!

Using the Goodreads API, I created a well-cleaned dataset with all the essential features book lovers need. Whether you're looking to discover your next great read, explore book details, or analyze trends, this dataset has you covered.

Check out my new 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐬 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐮 𝐃𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝! Dive into a world of books with solid numbers and insights. 🌟


A big thank you to Goodreads for their API, and to all bibliophiles—this one's for you! If you find this helpful, please give it an upvote. 📈
